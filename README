A Blender Addon to help you keep your meshes clean and lint-free.

When installed, it will add a new Subpanel to the Object Data properties (the
button in the Properties Editor that looks like the inverted triangle), at the
bottom, where you can have it point out:

  - Nonmanifold Elements: Edges that have < or > than 2 faces.
  - Tris: Evil.
  - Ngons: Also pretty bad.
  - Interior Faces: Faces spanning inside the mesh that cause confusing
      effects with Subsurf and Edge Loops.
  - 6+-Poles: Verts with 6 or more edges (check disabled by default).
  - ...more to come.
